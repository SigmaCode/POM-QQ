# SigmaCamp Problem of Month October 2023 Solution

This folder contains a solution to the October 2023 Computer Science PoM. It contains the following files: 

* `letterBoxed.py`: This file contains Python code used for both the 5- and 10-point problems.
* `fivepoint.py` and `tenpoint.py`: These files actually solve the two problems. They are essentially just wrappers for functions in `letterBoxed.py`.
* `lbtests.py`: Running this from the command line will generate test inputs and outputs for the 5- and 10-pt solutions and run the provided solution. The comments in the file indicate what output one should get. 
* `words.txt`: The official word list for the problem.
